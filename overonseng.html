        <p id="info">The LAM stems from the VandenBroek Foundation, which aims to make art accessible to a wide audience. The VandenBroek Foundation was founded by Jan van den Broek in 2008. The aim of the foundation is to stimulate young, cultural talent. The foundation is there for the makers and for the young viewers and listeners.<br>
            <br>
            The VandenBroek Foundation supports the talent show program of the Royal Concertgebouw, De Ateliers and the educational program of the Rijksmuseum's Teekenschool. Through the National Musical Instrument Fund she has loaned a special violin, a Guadagnini from 1764, to a talented violinist. Starting artists who want to participate in the innovative art fair This Art Fair can receive a contribution for a stand through the foundation. With this, the VandenBroek Foundation wants to stimulate entrepreneurship among young talent. In addition to supporting talent, the foundation collects visual art for the LAM.<br>
            <br>   
            The foundation wants to build an inspiring collection of artworks. Not only the art-historical context is important, but also the way of presenting and the experience of the young viewer.<br>
